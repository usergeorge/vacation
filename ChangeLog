- released 1.0 version. nothing further to change. 

93/11/19:

- improved capability to recognize the sender's internet address. The
  old version (1983!) extracted it from the "From " line which holds a
  UUCP bang path to the sender. Now, the address is extracted from the
  "From: " line which holds the address in domain name style which is
  less confusing to modern mail transport agents. If "From:" does not
  contain a `good' address, the UUCP bang path is converted.
- included manpages for aliases(5) and forward(5)
- set version number to 0.9. Version should be fairly complete.

93/11/18:

- Initial version. See README.

<h1>vacation - reply to mail automatically</h1>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre>vacation [ <i>-I</i> | <i>-i</i> ]
vacation  [ -j ] [ -a alias ] [ -tN ] [ -r ] [ -?  ] [ -h virtual
host name ] username
</pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>vacation automatically replies to incoming mail.  The reply
is contained in the file .vacation.msg in your home directory.
  The vacation program run interactively will create and/or edit
 a .vacation.msg file in your home directory. The old 
.vacation.msg will be backed up to .vacation.old file.  
Type vacation with no arguments.</p>
<p>For example, the message created by vacation is:</p>
<pre>
Subject: away from my mail
From:  smith (via the vacation program)
I will not be reading my mail for a while. Your
mail regarding "$SUBJECT" will be
read when I return.
</pre>
<p>The .vacation.msg file should include a header with at least a
'Subject:'line (it should not contain a 'To:' line and need not
 contain a 'From:' line, since these are generated
automatically).</p>

<p>The fields 'From', 'From:' and 'Reply-To:' are evaluated 
in the following order: If there is a 'Reply-To:', and the option -r 
is given, then its entry is accepted. Otherwise, the entry of the 'From:' 
field is taken. Should this entry lack a complete domain address
(e.g. user@site instead of user@site.domain), vacation evaluates the
'From' field, converting the contained UUCP bang path into a domain
style address. If this fails too, vacation gives up.</p>

<p>If the string <i>$SUBJECT</i> appears in the .vacation.msg file,
it is replaced with the subject of the original message when the 
reply is sent.</p>

<p>No message is sent if the 'To:' or the 'Cc:' line does not
 list the user to whom the original message was sent or one
 of a number of aliases for them, if the initial From line
 includes one of the strings -request@, postmaster, uucp,
 mailer-daemon, mailer or -relay or if a 'Precedence: bulk' 
or 'Precedence: junk' or 'Precedence: list' line is 
included in the header. The search for special senders is
made case-independant.</p>
<p> Vacation will also ignore any mails with <i>RFC-2369</i>
mail-list keywords.
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<ul>
<li>-I  Initialize the .vacation.db file and start vacation.<br>
If the -I flag is not specified, and a user argument is given,  
vacation reads the first line from the standard input (for a 'From:' 
line, no colon).  If absent, it produces an error message.<li></ul>

<p>The following options may be specified:</p>
<ul>
<li>-a  alias<br>
Indicate that alias is one of the valid aliases for
the user running vacation, so that mail addressed to that alias 
generates a reply.</li>

<li>-j  Do not check whether the recipient appears in the<br>
<i>To:</i> or the <i>Cc:</i> line. Reply always.</li>

<li>-tN Change the interval between repeat replies
to the same sender. N is the number of days between replies. Default is one
week.</li>

<li>-r  Use 'Reply-To:' Header<br>If there is a 'Reply-To:' header, send 
the automatic reply to the address given there.  Otherwise, use the
'From:' entry.</li>
<li>-h  hostname for virtual domain processing</li>
<li>-?  issue short usage line.</li>
</ul>
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<p>The vacation program, will create a .forward file in your home directory 
containing a line of the form:</p>
<pre>
\username, "|/usr/bin/vacation username"
</pre>
<p>where username is your login name. The original .forward will be backed 
up to .forward.old file.</p>
<p>Then type in the command:</p>
<p>vacation -I</p>
<p>To stop vacation, remove the .forward file, or move it to
 a new name.</p>

<p>If vacation is run with no arguments, it will create a new
 .vacation.msg file for you, using the editor specified by
 the VISUAL or EDITOR environment  variable, or vi(1) if 
neither of those environment variables are set.  If a 
.forward file is not present in your home directory, it 
creates it for you, and automatically performs a 'vacation -I' 
function, turning on vacation.</p>

<h2>FILES</h2>
<ul>
<li>$HOME/.forward</li>
<li>$HOME/.vacation.msg</li>
</ul>
<p>A list of senders is kept in the file <i>.vacation.db</i> in your 
home directory.</p>

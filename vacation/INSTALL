To install Vacation:

First edit Makefile and change your PREFIX to set where it should go (it
defaults to /usr at the moment, you may want /usr/local instead).

Now under Linux type 'make' and under FreeBSD type 'gmake' to compile
the program.   To install it you will need to do (as root) 'make install'
or, for FreeBSD, 'gmake install'.

That should install both the vacation binary and the man page to the
desired location.

N.B. If you encounter any difficulty in installing vacation, let me know.

For more info about the programs, see the man pages.

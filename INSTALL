To install Vacation: edit Makefile. Please note that there is one option
that can really only be changed and that is PFLAGS, set this to -DPOSTFIX if
you use Postfix. This is due to differences between the command line for
Postfix and Sendmail.

Now type 'make install'.
This should compile and install both the vacation binary and the man page at
their desired locations.

N.B. If you encounter any difficulty in installing cucipop, let me know.

For more info about the programs, see the man pages.
